<h1> Kenel Tree for CoolPad Note 3 (lollipop)</h1>

<h3>How to Compile this kernel :</h3>	
	
	1) Extract the kernel where ever you want.
	2) Open the terminal in extracted kernel directory
	3) Edit the toolchain path in start.sh
	4) Type . start.sh in terminal and press enter
	5) After it completes compiling, you will get an image.gz-dtb in arch/arm64/boot
	6) There ends the kernel building.
